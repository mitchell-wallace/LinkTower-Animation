My goal is to create a looping animation as promotional material for my open source link hub, LinkTower. This video will be looping on my personal portfolio website, which is built on top of the base LinkTower project. Here is how I want to do it.
1. Create a three-column layout with a range of CustomLink components to demonstrate a bit of what the project can do. These links should not contain images, videos, or carousels, with one exception - in the centre column we want a component that uses an image of the LinkTower logo. Use a mix of colours - base, primary, secondary, neutral, and a range of icons and link text to demonstrate a variety of uses. For example, links for social media, email newsletter signups, free ebook downloads, projects on GitHub / YouTube / Dribble, links to blog posts, etc. Use a mix of same tab, new tab, and download links to vary the right hand side icon. The centre column should have the LinkTower logo image on every second component.
2. We then want these columns to scroll on a loop; middle column scrolls down, others go up. Scrolling speed should be medium-slow. This should happen within a 3:2 aspect ratio frame; the frame can have a border or not, as long as there's no border in the final video output. Frame should be about 720p resolution. At this point we need to ensure the loop can seamlessly export to a short video - so the left and right columns should have the exact same height, and the centre column's height should be either the exact same or a perfect ratio of the sides e.g. 50%. That way, our final looping video won't have any discontinuity around the looping point. I was thinking somewhere around 15 seconds as a rough figure for the video length, but anywhere around 10-30 seconds or so should be fine.
3. We then want to rotate the content about 30° clockwise, and adjust the scaling and position so that it covers most of the way from diagonal to diagonal with a bit of appropriate padding for comfort.
4. Then we want a way to export the contents of the frame, with the exact timing for the loop. This is the lowest priority, as if needed I can just screen record and edit the video, so make sure that this export mechanism doesn't affect the visibility of the core animation content. However, it would be convenient if we could programmatically export the video. Think about different ways we could do this and try to go for a reliable approach that isn't over-engineered.
